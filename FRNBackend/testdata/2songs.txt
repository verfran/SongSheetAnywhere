<Title>
Above all
Above all powers, above all kings
Above all nature and all created things
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man
You were here before the world began

Above all kingdoms above all thrones
Above all wonders 
The world has ever known
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
There's no way to measure 
What You're worth

<Chorus>
Crucified laid behind a stone
You lived to die rejected and alone
Like a rose trampled on the ground
You took the fall and thought of me
Above all



<Title>
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name in the land that is plentiful where Your streams of abundance flow Blessed be Your name
Blessed be Your name when I'm found in the desert place though I walk through the wilderness Blessed be Your name

<Prechorus>
Every blessing You pour out I'll
turn back to praise.
When the darkness closes in, Lord
Still I will say

<Chorus>
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

Blessed be Your name when the sun's shining down on me. When the world's "all as it should be Blessed be Your name
Blessed be Your name on the road marked with suffering Though there's pain in the offering Blessed be Your name

<Bridge>
Give and take away
You give and take away
Heart will choose to say
Lord, blessed be Your name
